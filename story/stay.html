		<h1>The Endless Elevator</h1>
		<p> You have chosen to stay inside and see where the elevator goes. The elevator continues climbing, eventually reaching numbers you didn't even know existed. The door finally opens to FLOOR 23447593724 and you step into a yellow dimly lit hallway that seems to never end. You've reached the backrooms. You feel an eerie presence behind you, a monster. Before you can react, it lunges at you and everything goes dark.
