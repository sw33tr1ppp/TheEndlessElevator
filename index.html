		<h1>The Endless Elevator</h1>

		<p>You step into the elevator at the mall late at night and press your floor, but it doesn’t stop. It moves past your stop, continuously shooting up through every floor it’s supposed to stop at. Surprisingly, everything seems normal. The lights are working, the motor is running, and even the elevator music is playing, yet the elevator keeps climbing to floors that shouldn't even exist.</p>
